# Cub3d - Ecole 42 Project

Cub3d is a project assigned by Ecole 42, a coding school located in Paris, France. The goal of this project is to create a 3D graphics engine that can display a cube and its movements in a 2D window. The engine should use a graphics library like MLX to display the graphics. The cube should be able to move in any direction and should be able to be rotated.

## Requirements
- MLX library (provided by Ecole 42)
- GCC compiler
- Makefile
- X11 library

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sametyldrmm/Cub3d-Ecole42`
- Navigate to the root directory of the project using `cd Cub3d-Ecole42`
- Compile the project using the `make` command
- Execute the binary file using the command `./Cub3d map.cub`

## Usage
The project can be used by executing the binary file with a .cub file as an argument. The .cub file should contain the information about the cube's size, position, and movements.

## Features
- Display of a 3D cube in a 2D window
- Ability to move the cube in any direction
- Ability to rotate the cube
